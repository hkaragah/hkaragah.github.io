# Welcome

This resource is designed for students, researchers, and professionals interested in the intersection of **structural engineering**, **structural dynamics**, **earthquake engineering**, **data science**, **machine learning**, and **artificial intelligence**. Drawing from my academic and professional experience, this book bridges traditional engineering knowledge with modern computational tools and AI-driven insights.

## About the Author
